// This method should be called to initialize the heap area in your program,
// before calling any other methods. It returns 0 for a successful initializing

// make an initial size for the Heap segment. All memory allocation for dynamic
// usage should be done within this part.

// This method returns a pointer to the allocated block in the Heap with size
// bytes (at least). This is an entire separated block within the Heap and
// should not have any overlap with the other allocated blocks. The method
// should search to find the best fit in the Heap for that given size and
// allocate it. In this process the memory has already been divided into various
// size of blocks. To manage these blocks a mechanism is provided at
// section 3.1.3 using a linked-list. Each node in this linked-list, naming
// h_Node, is connected to a block in the Heap and contains its information.
// Thus for tracking the information about each block, its relevant h_Node
// should be checked

// This method returns the allocated block pointed to by ptr to the free space
// of the Heap. This method should work if and only if the ptr is valid, meaning
// that the m_free(ptr) should be called following a call to m_malloc() or
// m_realloc() that already generated its ptr parameter. Like the real free()
// method, the m_fee() should set the allocated block as a free block now, and
// this should be done by modifying the information in the relevant h_Node of
// that block. Moreover, it should also check if the previous and/or next blocks
// are free or not, and if yes, join them to the current free block to make a
// bigger free block and finally update all the relevant h_Nodes.

// This method returns a pointer to the new allocated block in the Heap with
// size bytes (at least) after resizing an old block pointed to by ptr. This is
// an entire separated block within the Heap and should not have any overlap
// with the other allocated blocks.
// This method changes the size of the old block pointed to by ptr. The address
// of the new ptr could be the same as the old ptr or be different. Note that
// the content of the common parts between the old and the new blocks should be
// the same. For example if the old block has the size=200 bytes and the new
// block has the size=250 bytes, this means that the first 200 bytes of both
// blocks are the same (actually the old block will be replaced by the new one,
// but the contents should be kept for the common size).
